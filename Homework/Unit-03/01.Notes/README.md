Notes: Player_Dealer_Correlation

	-I believe Mylie Schmidt and Billy Jones are colluding to scam Lucky Duck.

	-Both Mylie and Billy were present thirteen times when losses occured for Lucky Duck. 
	I think collusion may have occured due to a reoccuring pattern of losses. 
	The losses occured at very specific times throughout the course of the day on all three days, and both parties were present each time.
