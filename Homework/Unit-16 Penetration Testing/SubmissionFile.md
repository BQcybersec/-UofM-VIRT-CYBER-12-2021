### Step 5: Zenmap

Your client has asked that you help identify any vulnerabilities with their file-sharing server. Using the Metasploitable machine to act as your client's server, complete the following:

- Command for Zenmap to run a service scan against the Metasploitable machine: 

`nmap -sV 192.168.0.10`
 
- Bonus command to output results into a new text file named `zenmapscan.txt`:

`nmap -sV -oN zenmapscan.txt 192.168.0.10`

- Zenmap vulnerability script command: 

`nmap -T4 -A -v --script ftp-vsftpd-backdoor 192.168.0.10

- Once you have identified this vulnerability, answer the following questions for your client:
  1. What is the vulnerability:
  
  - CVE-2011-2523 contains a backdoor which opens a shell on port 6200

  2. Why is it dangerous:

    - If someone used the backdoor they would have a shell in the server where they could execute commands and access your data.
